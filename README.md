# MTG - Josh's Cardboard

### Overview
  * The purpose of our app is to simplify the purchasing process with an integrated backend that manages real-time updates to orders, card stock, and employee information.
---
### Description
  * Our project uses a MariaDB database to store and manage all our application data. We containerized the backend using Docker, which allows the database and API services to be connected for future use. Docker also enables seamless communication between the backend and the Angular application. The system then updates properly through the use of HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which in turn allows the application to update in real time as changes are made. The Angular frontend then displays all updated information from the database, which in turn the company will be able to use on a day-to-day basis for orders, card stock, and employee information.
